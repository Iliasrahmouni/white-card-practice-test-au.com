            <section>
                <p>This comprehensive <strong>White Card practice test</strong> helps you prepare for the <strong>CPCCWHS1001</strong> unit, the mandatory construction induction training required to work on Australian construction sites. Our practice test contains <strong>240 official questions</strong> based on the <strong>Work Health and Safety (WHS) Act</strong> and Australian Safety Standards including <strong>AS 1319</strong> (Safety Signs) and <strong>AS 2444</strong> (Fire Safety). Whether you're preparing for your <strong>White Card NSW</strong>, <strong>White Card VIC</strong>, <strong>White Card QLD</strong>, or any other state, our practice questions align with all Australian construction safety standards.</p>
                
                <h3>State-Specific White Card Training and Regulators</h3>
                <p>While the White Card is recognized nationally across all Australian states and territories, each state has its own workplace safety regulator. Understanding your state's regulator is important:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SafeWork NSW</strong> - Regulates workplace safety in New South Wales</li>
                    <li><strong>WorkSafe Victoria</strong> - Oversees safety in Victoria</li>
                    <li><strong>WorkSafe Queensland</strong> - Manages workplace safety in Queensland</li>

                        A <strong>White Card</strong> (also known as a Construction Induction Card or General Construction Induction Card) is mandatory for anyone working on construction sites in Australia. The certification covers essential safety knowledge including legal responsibilities under the WHS Act, hazard identification and control, safety signs and tags (AS 1319), emergency and fire procedures (AS 2444), and high-risk work requirements. The official unit code is <strong>CPCCWHS1001 - Prepare to work safely in the construction industry</strong>.

                            <li><strong>Legal Responsibilities (WHS Act)</strong> - Duty of Care, PCBU responsibilities, worker rights, HSR roles, and compliance requirements</li>

                        The official White Card test typically requires a 100% pass rate, meaning you must answer all questions correctly. Our practice test follows this same standard to ensure you're fully prepared. The test covers critical safety knowledge that could save lives on construction sites, so thorough preparation is essential.

                        Yes. The White Card is nationally recognised across all Australian states and territories. Each region has its own safety regulator (for example SafeWork NSW, WorkSafe Victoria, WorkSafe Queensland and others), but the core CPCCWHS1001 requirements are the same. Our practice questions are designed to match these common standards so you can use this test no matter which state you plan to work in.

                        This practice test is for educational purposes only. We are not affiliated with SafeWork, WorkSafe, or any Australian government agency. For official White Card certification, you must complete training through an accredited Registered Training Organisation (RTO). This practice test helps you prepare but does not replace official training.
